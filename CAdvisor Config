cAdvisor provides insights into resource usage and performance characteristics of running containers, follow these steps:

Ensure you have Docker installed and running on your server where other containers are running which you want to monitor


Set up cAdvisor as a docker container by executing the below command:

  docker run \
  --volume=/:/rootfs:ro \
  --volume=/var/run:/var/run:ro \
  --volume=/sys:/sys:ro \
  --volume=/var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro \
  --volume=/dev/disk/:/dev/disk:ro \
  --publish=7070:8080 \
  --detach=true \
  --privileged \
  --name=cadvisor \
  google/cadvisor:latest



The above commnad mounts necessary paths and exposes cAdvisor on port 7070.



Accessing cAdvisor
   Once cAdvisor is running, you can access the web interface by navigating to `http://<your-server-ip>:7070` in your web browser.



Integration with prometheus, you can scrape cAdvisor metrics by adding the following lines in your prometheus.yml config file.

  vi /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'cadvisor'
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['<your-server-ip>:7070']


This will set up cAdvisor to monitor your Docker containers' performance metrics.
